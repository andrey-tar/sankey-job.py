For a visualisation of my job hunt efforts I decided to create a Sankey diagram showing the funnel of my applications and outcomes. The data is stored on the Google Sheets, so the script pulls the data from it and transforms it into the Sankey chart. However, I ended up using the chart-builder https://www.sankeymatic.com/ because Plotly charts looked ugly for this particular purposes.
